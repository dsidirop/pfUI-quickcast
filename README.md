The '/pfquickcast@*' family of commands are more performant flavours of the original '/pfcast' command from pfUI.mouseover module.

They are designed to be used in macros for casting spells on friendly, enemy or neutral targets in a more efficient and intuitive way
while taking into account those corner-cases that the original '/pfcast' command has a very hard time dealing with properly.

## üöë  Heal-Auto-Ranking Addons Supporting '/pfquickcast@heal*' Commands

List of heal-auto-ranking addons that support the '/pfquickcast@heal*' commands:

- [SmartHealer (extended)](https://github.com/dsidirop/SmartHealer):

  This is a fork of the original SmartHealer addon which supports the '/pfquickcast@heal*' commands among other QoL changes.

  Note: The original one can be found here [SmartHealer (original)](https://github.com/melbaa/SmartHealer) and doesn't support '/pfquickcast@heal*' commands.

## üìú Basic Usage:

- `/pfquickcast@heal <healing_spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL("<healing_spell_name>")` )

  <br/>Casts healing spells on **friendly** targets in the following order of priority:

  <br/>- If the mouse hovers over a friendly unit-frame (or toon in the game world), then that friendly unit will be healed. 

  <br/>- Otherwise the healing spell will be cast on the currently selected friendly target (if any.)

  <br/>- If no suitable target is found in the above cases, the spell will **not** be cast even if you have AutoSelfCast=true in your CVars. This behaviour is by design
  the exact opposite to what '/pfcast' does, so that you won't accidentally heal yourself when you meant to heal someone else thus wasting both mana and precious time in a raid context.
  
  <br/>- Note that you can in fact specify multiple healing spells in a single macro. If the first spell is not castable due to cooldown or because you haven't picked it in your talent
  tree, the next one will be tried to be cast and so on:
  
  <br/>A typical use-case of this feature is with the Paladin's 'Holy Shock' talent:

  ```
  /pfquickcast@heal Holy Shock, Flash of Light(Rank 3)     -- if you have the 'Holy Shock' talent in your talent build and it is off cooldown, it will be cast, otherwise 'Flash of Light' will be cast
  
  /script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL("Holy Shock, Flash of Light(Rank 3)")     -- equivalent LUA call
  ```

  <br/>Notes: The above feature can't be used as-is to fall back to lower ranks of the same spell if the first spell in the list is not castable due to low mana. If you want to achieve this
  one way to do it is this one:
 
  ```
  /pfquickcast@heal Holy Shock,         Flash of Light --                 primary heal 
  /pfquickcast@heal Holy Shock(Rank 1), Flash of Light --                 if you've run low on mana and none of the previous spells can be cast it will fall through to one of these heals
  /pfquickcast@heal Holy Shock(Rank 1), Flash of Light(Rank 3) --         if you've run even lower on mana it will fall through to one of these heals
  ```

  <br/>Equivalent LUA script:

  ```lua
  SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL("Holy Shock,         Flash of Light        ")
  SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL("Holy Shock(Rank 1), Flash of Light        ")
  SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL("Holy Shock(Rank 1), Flash of Light(Rank 3)")
  ```

  <br/>Or as a one-liner:

  ```
  /script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL("Holy Shock, Flash of Light"); SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL("Holy Shock(Rank 1), Flash of Light"); SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL("Holy Shock(Rank 1), Flash of Light(Rank 3)")
  ```

  <br/>- The first spell in the comma separated list of spells, that was valid and not on CD will be return by the LUA call and if no spell met those criteria then 'nil' will be returned.
  
  <br/>**Do bear in mind however that just because a spell is returned it doesn't necessarily mean that it was cast successfully. If for example you run too low on mana then the spell will not be cast even though it
  will be returned by the method. This is a known shortcoming but in practice you can work around it in the manner shown above to fall through to other spells.**<br/> 

  <br/>Note: Heals cast with this flavour do get intercepted by healing auto-ranking addons.<br/><br/>


- `/pfquickcast@healself <healing_spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL_SELF("<healing_spell_name>")` )

  <br/>Casts healing spells on your **character** no matter what.

  <br/>Note: Heals cast with this flavour do get intercepted by healing auto-ranking addons.<br/><br/>

- `/pfquickcast@healtote <spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL_TOTE("<spell_name>")` )

  <br/>Casts heals to the target-of-the-enemy (tote). This will work **only** if you're mouse-hovering over an **enemy** unit in which case it will find the friendly target that it's attacking
  to heal it.

  <br/>- Note that this flavour will automatically **change** your current target to the enemy unit you're mouse-hovering over. Use with caution.

  <br/>- This flavour is meant to be used mainly when healing boss-fights that necessitate tank swaps, in which case you want your heals to land automatically on the tank that the boss is currently
  attacking at any given moment.<br/>

  <br/>- You can combine this flavour with others so that it will do the right thing depending on whether you mouse-hover a friendly target or an enemy one.<br/>

  ```                                                        
  -- you can bind this macro to your scroll-wheel-up/down for effective spam healing via mouse-hover

  /pfquickcast@heal       Holy Shock, Flash of Light
  /pfquickcast@healtote   Holy Shock, Flash of Light
  ```
  
  ```lua
  SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL("Holy Shock, Flash of Light")
  SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL_TOTE("Holy Shock, Flash of Light")
  ```
  <br/>Or as a one-liner:

  ```
  /script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL("Holy Shock, Flash of Light"); SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_HEAL_TOTE("Holy Shock, Flash of Light");
  ```
  <br/>

- `/pfquickcast@friendtote <spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_FRIEND_TOTE("<spell_name>")` )

  <br/>Casts the spell specified to the target-of-the-enemy (tote). This will work **only** if you're mouse-hovering over an **enemy** unit in which case it will find the friendly target that it's attacking
  to heal it.

  <br/>- Note that this flavour will automatically **change** your current target to the enemy unit you're mouse-hovering over. Use with caution.

  <br/>- This flavour is meant to be used mainly for non-healing spells or for healing spells that you want to be cast as-is (without being processed by auto-ranking addons).<br/>

  <br/>- You can combine this flavour with others so that it will do the right thing depending on whether you mouse-hover a friendly target or an enemy one.<br/>

  ```
  /pfquickcast@friend       Blessing of Protection
  /pfquickcast@friendtote   Blessing of Protection
  ```

  ```lua
  SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_FRIEND("Blessing of Protection")
  SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_FRIEND_TOTE("Blessing of Protection")
  ```
  <br/>Or as a one-liner:

  ```
  /script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_FRIEND("Blessing of Protection"); SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_FRIEND_TOTE("Blessing of Protection");
  ```
  <br/>

- `/pfquickcast@self <spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_SELF("<spell_name>")` )

  <br/>Casts spells on your **character** no matter what.

  <br/>Note that (normally) this flavour is not interceptable by heal-auto-ranking addons and should be used for spells that are meant to be cast
  exactly as you specify them on your character.<br/><br/>


- `/pfquickcast@friend <spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_FRIEND("<spell_name>")` )

  <br/>Casts spells on **friendly** targets p.e. on pfUI frames via mouse-hover.

  <br/>Use this flavour for **friendly** spells or generic spells that can be used on both friendly and enemy targets (p.e. Paladin's Holy Shock).

  <br/>Note that (normally) this flavour is not interceptable by heal-auto-ranking addons and should be used for spells that are meant to be cast
  exactly as you specify them on friendly targets.<br/><br/>

- `/pfquickcast@intervene <spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_INTERVENE("<spell_name>")` )

  <br/>Using this command while targeting an enemy will cast the given spell to the friendly player (other than yourself) targeted by the enemy unit.

  This is useful for situations where you want to cast spells like "Blessing of Protection" on a party member that's being attacked by a boss but you
  want to make sure that you will not accidentally cast blessing of protection on yourself!

  Although you can heal with this command bare in mind that said heals, normally, do not be intercepted by heal-auto-ranking addons and are cast as given.

  ```
  /pfquickcast@intervene   Blessing of Protection
  ```
  
  Or in LUA:

  ```lua
  SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_INTERVENE("Blessing of Protection")
  ```

- `/pfquickcast@enemy <spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_ENEMY("<spell_name>")` )

  <br/>Casts spells on **enemy / neutral** targets p.e. via mouse-hover directly on the NPCs or in pfUI unit-frames.

  <br/>- You can in fact specify multiple spells in a single macro. If the first spell is not castable (p.e. out of range, on CD, etc.) the next one will be attempted to be cast and so on.

  <br/>Use this flavour for **offensive** spells or generic spells that can be used on both friendly and enemy targets (p.e. Paladin's Holy Shock).<br/><br/>


- `/pfquickcast@directenemy <spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_DIRECT_ENEMY("<spell_name>")` )

  <br/>Casts spells on your direct **enemy / neutral** target. If you have no enemy currently selected the command will select the enemy under your mouse cursor if any. 

  <br/>- You can in fact specify multiple spells in a single macro. If the first spell is not castable (p.e. out of range, on CD, etc.) the next one will be attempted to be cast and so on.

  <br/>Use this flavour for **offensive** spells or generic spells that can be used on both friendly and enemy targets (p.e. Paladin's Holy Shock).<br/><br/>


- `/pfquickcast@enemytbf <spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_ENEMY_TBF("<spell_name>")` )

  <br/>**@enemytbf** stands for **enemy-targeted-by-friend**, and it's the inverse of @healtote in the sense that you now mouse-hover over a
  **friendly** unit and the spell will be cast on the **enemy** target that your friend is attacking. Like @healtote this flavour will automatically
  change your current target to the friendly unit you're mouse-hovering over. So use it with caution.

  <br/>You can use this flavor in a specialized macro to:

  - Always track & attack the tank's current target.<br/>
  - It's also useful in **multi-boxing scenarios** where you want your follower-chars to always attack the target of your leading char.<br/><br/>

  You can even combine this flavour with others so that it will do the right thing depending on whether you mouse-hover a friendly target or an enemy one.<br/>

  ```
  /pfquickcast@enemy    Frostbolt   -- if you mouse-hover over an enemy target or if you dont mouse-hover anything but you have an enemy already selected
  /pfquickcast@enemytbf Frostbolt   -- if you mouse-hover over a friendly target your spells will be sent to the enemy target that your friend is attacking
  ```

  ```lua
  SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_ENEMY("Frostbolt")
  SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_ENEMY_TBF("Frostbolt")
  ```

  <br/>Or as a one-liner scriptlet:

  ```
  /script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_ENEMY("Frostbolt"); SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_ENEMY_TBF("Frostbolt")
  ```
  <br/>


- `/pfquickcast@any <spell_name>` ( `/script SlashCmdList.PFQUICKCAST_ANY("<spell_name>")` )

  <br/>Casts spells to any target (friendly, neutral or enemy) p.e. on pfUI frames via mouse-hover.<br/>

## ‚ùì Why pfUI-QuickCast?

- **Performance**: The '/pfquickcast@heal' command is leaner and more performant than the original '/pfcast' command from pfUI.mouseover module.

  <br/>The original implementation of '/pfcast' command constantly invokes 'loadstring()' under the hood to evaluate the spell name string passed to it.
  Even though this works fine for most cases, it's just too much churning for too little gain when used in macros that are executed frequently
  such as healing macros that healers spam in a raid context:<br/><br/>

  'Flash of Light'<br/>
  Down-ranked 'Healing Touch'<br/>
  'Rejuvenation'<br/>

  <br/>One could argue that /pfcast could be refactored further so that 'loadstring()' could be wrapped and made smarter with some sort of caching mechanism
  for the most commonly used LUA scripts passed to it, but that's just feels as flogging an ailing horse.<br/><br/>

- **Intention**: The '/pfquickcast@heal' command and only that is intercept-able by healing auto-ranking addons for optimum performance.<br/><br/>

- **Targeting**: The implementation of the '/pfquickcast@heal' is such that it only casts spells on **friendly** targets.<br/>

  <br/>This is important for spells like 'Holy Shock' that can be used on both friendly and enemy targets. The '/pfcast' command on the contrary
  is not aware of the target type and will cast 'Holy Shock' on the currently selected target if it's enemy prioritizing it over the friendly
  target that you intend to heal with mouse-over. :(

  <br/>If someone wants to force '/pfcast' to cast 'Holy Shock' on the friendly mouse-over target (even if an enemy target is selected), they would have to
  resort to writing a LUA wrapper-script. This sort of "LUA heartburn" is no longer necessary with the '/pfquickcast@heal' command.

  <br/>This is just one of the many issues plaguing the original '/pfcast' command that '/pfquickcast@heal' fixes right ouf of the box.


- **Simplicity of Integration with Heal-Auto Ranking Addons**: The '/pfquickcast@heal' command works seamlessly and transparently with heal-auto-ranking
  addons that support it.<br/><br/>

  Unless you want to do something very advanced using your own custom LUA macro-script, there's absolutely no need to write counter-intuitive LUA scripts.<br/><br/>

  This is how simply '/pfquickcast@heal' is meant to be used with heal auto-ranking addons:<br/>

  ```
   /pfquickcast@heal Holy Light   -- the heal auto-ranking addon will intercept this call and cast the most appropriate rank of 'Holy Light' based on the target's health
  ```

  With the '/pfquickcast@heal' approach if you decide to switch over to another heal-auto-ranking addon you don't have to edit any of your macros - simply switch
  over to your new heal-auto-ranking addon and everything will work transparently (provided of course that your new heal-auto-ranking addon supports /pfquickcast@heal indeed).<br/><br/>

  Just for the sake of comparison, here's how the built-in '/pfcast' command is meant to be used with heal auto-ranking addons:<br/>

  ```
   /pfcast YourPreferredHealAutoRankingAddon:Cast("Holy Light")
  ```

  Apart from an alienating syntax, this approach means that if you decide to switch over to another heal-auto-ranking addon **you're forced into "LUA heartburn" by having to manually
  edit all your macros** to reflect the new heal-auto-ranking addon's API.<br/><br/>
